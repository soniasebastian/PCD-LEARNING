Introduction to CI/CD Pipeline
-Developer push codes to some Source code repository like Bitbucket, Github and build Server
-Continuously build, code is good and working fine
- something changes, again push code and Build server
- pushing code continuosly to source code repository


Continuous Deployment
- Builds artifacts
- Kinds of enviroment will fix the Deployment Server
- We get continuous status on code working/performance


Continuous deployment
-Fully automated, no manual intervention
-code is continuously build and deploy

Continuous Delivery
-Release to Production
-May involve manual approval
-it will make sure delivery are often and fast
-before continuous delivery frequency of release usually one in 3 month
-Now possible to relase in 5 times in day

(2) Different services for CI/CD offered by Google cloud

Source code maangement
- Bitbucket
-GitHub
-Mercurial

Google provided ------ Cloud source Repository
build code using build tools

BUILD
-JAVA NODE APPS
  -JAR FILE, VAR FILE

  JENKINS

  TEAMCITY

  GOOGLE OFFERS cloud Build



After build artifacts generated
- dockerhub
-artifact storage
-jfrog artifactory
-AmazonS3


  google -Container Registry
         -Artifact registry (store not only docker, but all files like JAR, VAR ETC) ADVANCED VERSION
