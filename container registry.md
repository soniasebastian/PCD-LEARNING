Container


software shipping technology

Building a Java app   

  Java runtime (JRE)
  
  aLL LIBRARY DPENDENCY
  
  NETWORK CONFIGURATION
  
  RUNTIME DLL

  Combine all this into one Single bucket & ship
  
  Compare with oops
  
  images like class(Blueprint)
  
  Container like Objects

  Container to replace VMs but due to many advantages

  VM   : ops(kernals), Hypervisor ...small OS ....EACH BEHAVE AS ONE OS...where app is deployed
  Conatiner: No separate OS, DOCKER BASED ..SO MANY APPS...

  Conatiners are light weighted
  Easily portable to any public cloud, vm, bare metal
  For micro service deployment, light-weighted conatiners are prefered
  Fast CI/CD cycle
  All major public cloud providers has services to deploy container

  In GCP
  vm, Cloud RUN, GKE


  DOCKER
  
  Conatiner are abstract concept
  
  Docker is specific implementation of container concept
  
  Create Docker images, from Images can create multiple containers
  
  Here you packaged app in images
  
  Containers use image to start application
  
  Containers run on any OS-linux prefered
  
  Works exactly same independent of OS, machine, environment
  
  Lightweighted compared to VM
  
  EaSIER TO MAINTAIN AND DEPLOY
  
  Docker works with any language, runtime, OS

  DOCKER WORKFLOW

  Docker installation
  
  dockerfile + source code
  . 
  .
  .
  Docker image ...docker hub(conatiner registry, artifact registry, aws ecr)
  
  ....Docker Container
