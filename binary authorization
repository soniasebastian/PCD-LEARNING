It's running!
Congratulations, you successfully deployed a container image to Cloud Run
This created the revision sec-con-run-00001-cwq of the Cloud Run service sec-con-run in us-central1 in the GCP project snappy-benefit-421114.

You can deploy any container to Cloud Run that listens for HTTP requests on the port defined by the PORT environment variable. Cloud Run will scale automatically based on requests and you never have to worry about infrastructure.

What's next?
Follow the Quickstart tutorial to build a “Hello World” application in your favorite language into a container image, and then deploy it to Cloud Run.

cloud run..deploy a revision to sec-con-run(us-central-1)


creating revision
routing traffic....completed


successfully deploy docker images with BA , WE INTRODUCED DEMO ATTESTOR CONCEPT IN DEFAULT POLICY

SAME WAY FOR KUBERNETES CLUSTERS ALSO


(III) KUBERNETES CLUSTER 

EXACTLY LIKE CLOUD RUN ONLY

CLUSTER BASICS

CREATE CLUSTER WITH GKE STANDARD
BINARY AUTHORIZATION POLICY CREATED UNDER SECURITY REMAINS SAME

CLUSTER 1

10GB BOOT DISK

2VCPU, 2GIGS RAM

CLUSTER LEVEL SECURITY

SECURITY..enable BINARY AUTHORIZATION

CREATE CLUSTER,,,VERSION 1 NOT ATTESTED

CHECK WHETHER BINARY AUTHORISATION IS ENABLED, ONLY VERIFIED IMAGES WILL BE DEPLOYED


....

Go to worload and deploy version 1.0

app name: my-app-1: image denied request

No attestations found valid and signed by a key trusted by attestor


......

next try with version 2...
name:my-app-2
deploy version 2 image

Binary authorisation works same for cloud run and GKE
