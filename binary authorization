It's running!
Congratulations, you successfully deployed a container image to Cloud Run
This created the revision sec-con-run-00001-cwq of the Cloud Run service sec-con-run in us-central1 in the GCP project snappy-benefit-421114.

You can deploy any container to Cloud Run that listens for HTTP requests on the port defined by the PORT environment variable. Cloud Run will scale automatically based on requests and you never have to worry about infrastructure.
