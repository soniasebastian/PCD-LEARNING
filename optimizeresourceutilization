Optimize resource utilization
- Resource cost, utilization levels, Biling
-Pre-emptible VMs
-Committed use discounts (cud) , sustained use discounts(sud)
TCO (total cost of operations) considerations


Preemptible VM
-Just like other vm
- Short lived cheaper vm
-Provision pre-embitible VM When
   -workload is fault tolerant
   -not require 100% high availability
   -cost is critical
   -upto 80% discount
   -max life 24 hours
   -not always available
   -google gives 30s warning before autoshutdown
   - Regular VM has higher priority than pre-embtible VM
   -TERMINATED SOONER DUE TO SYSTEM DEMANDS


   Flat rate,
   committed use discounts [CUD]
   sustained use discount


   Flat rate
   -pay for what you use
   -no special discount
   -in compute engine:
   E2 and A2 category of machine

   Sustained use discount
   -Sustained use discounts are automatic discounts for running specific compute engine resources a significant portion of the billing month
   -Applies to N1, N2 machine types
   -Not applicable to other machine type
   -if you use at least 25% of month
   -only on GKE & VM instances


   Committed use discount
   -Lets say your workload is predictable
   -you can commit for 1 year or 3 year
   -get upto 70% of discount
   - only on GKE & VM Instances


   Total cost of Operations(TCO)
   TCO = Purchase cost of asset + cost of operation
   when moving to cloud from on premises
   -cost need to consider
   -In GCP no purchse of asset
   Provision resources with no minimum commitment(expect few service feature)
   -cost include (pay as you go model)
   -Operation cost
