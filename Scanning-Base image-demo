In this we are building and pushing an image, python 3.7 slim image we took from internet and are trying to watch out for vulnerabilities
later on to fix that with google build ones so that we can rectify those vulnerabilities



docker push gcr.io/snappy-benefit-421114/sec-image:v1.0 

creates sec-imagev1.0 in gcp.io with many vulnerabilities


Search for python in Google market place .....Google click to deploy containers

https://marketplace.gcr.io/google/python


we are replacing docker python image with latest google market place python image


gcloud auth configure-docker && docker pull marketplace.gcr.io/google/python:latest

the image from google is 375.1 MB than other image, but vulnerabilities : none
